                I studied Full Stack Web Development through Lambda School where
                I learned plenty of hard and soft skills in a span of 9 months.
                I worked with groups to build multiple apps. It was a
                challenging journey, and I gave back by becoming a Team Lead at
                the school to help current students learn to code. My technical
                skills were solidified as a Team Lead by learning to read and
                debug multiple studentsâ€™ codes. Seeing my students grow so fast
                has made me proud, and I am rooting for each and every one of
                them.

                I began contractual work at Strongmind, helping build
                interactive educational platforms. I enjoyed working for
                education as I got to learn scientific facts while I work!

                I am currently looking for more experience in Web Development. I
                have been schooling and working remotely, so I am all set and
                ready to work remotely or in office.With a passion in
                eco-solutions, I hope to, one day, use my development skills to
                provide a positive impact to mother nature.
