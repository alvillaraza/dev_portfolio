        I studied Full Stack Web Development through Lambda School where I
        learned plenty of hard and soft skills in a span of 9 months. I worked
        with groups to build multiple apps. It was a challenging journey, and I
        gave back by becoming a Team Lead at the school to help current students
        learn to code. My technical skills were solidified as a Team Lead by
        learning to read and debug multiple studentsâ€™ codes. Seeing my students
        grow so fast has made me proud, and I am rooting for each and every one
        of them.

        I am currently looking for more experience in Web Development. With a
        passion in eco-solutions, I hope to, one day, use my development skills to provide
        a positive impact to mother nature.
